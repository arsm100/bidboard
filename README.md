# BidBoard Flask Server

BidBoard is a web app through which advertisers can upload and publish their advertisements on billboards. Time slot booking is competitive and open to bidding. Pitched at Next Academyâ€™s graduation event and won all contested awards as it was voted the Best App, Best Creativity and Best Pitch.

The backend was built in Python with Flask and PostgreSQL while the frontend utilised React. An AI model was trained using Machine Learning to moderate the content of the media without human interference.

(The backend server is hosted on Heroku and hence has a bit of a "cold start". Therefore, the very first request might take a couple of seconds to get a response as the server spins up. All subsequent requests should be at the expected high speed)
